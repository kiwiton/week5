# week5
examen oefening
with this project i will try to connect the bmp280 sensor & bh1750, read them, and after that we display them on an oled display

the schema sensoreWeek5 shows how I wired it all together

it is a pity it didn't work because of some error with the libraries

in main.ccp you find the code i used its foreseen to be uploaded in the esp32 and cumicates via I2C
